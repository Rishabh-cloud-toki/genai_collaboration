= AI Agents Design Documentation

== Objective

Design and implement three AI-powered agents to automate the technical interview pipeline for hiring. These agents work collaboratively to:

1. **Agent 1 - IntelliQuest**: Conduct contextual interviews based on a candidate's resume and generate detailed interview transcripts.
2. **Agent 2 - TalentScout**: Use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to scan resumes and shortlist the top candidates based on user-defined requirements. It can trigger a tool to schedule interviews.
3. **Agent 3 - MatchMaker**: Analyze interview outcomes, rate candidates, and provide a comparative analysis to help make final hiring decisions.

== High-Level Solution

=== IntelliQuest (Agent 1 - Interviewer)

*Inputs*: Resume, role/context (e.g., "Java Backend Developer with 6 years experience"), and optionally a list of focus areas.

*Functionality*:

* Parses the resume and identifies relevant topics.
* Conducts a multi-turn interview, tracking both agent and user responses.
* Stores a detailed transcript with:

* All Q\&A exchanges
* Expected answers
* Commentary on correctness, depth, and clarity
* Sends structured output to the MatchMaker agent for evaluation.

=== TalentScout (Agent 2 - Sourcing)

*Inputs*: Job description, technical and soft skill requirements, years of experience, etc.

*Functionality*:

* Uses RAG to search through a database of resumes.
* Ranks resumes based on relevance and presents top 3–4 matches.
* On user approval, invokes a scheduling tool (via a TOOL interface) to send interview invites.

=== MatchMaker (Agent 3 - Matcher)

*Inputs*: Transcripts and scoring metadata from IntelliQuest.

*Functionality*:

* Applies predefined scoring rules per category (e.g., Problem Solving, System Design, Communication).
* Computes an overall rating.
* Compares multiple interview results and explains trade-offs.
* Produces a structured summary of best-fit candidates.

==== IntelliQuest C4 Diagram (Summary)

This diagram illustrates the components of the IntelliQuest agent that manages AI-driven interviews.

*Actor*: Candidate - Interacts with the UI to take the interview.

*Containers*:
- Interview UI (React/Angular): Frontend for interview interaction.
- IntelliQuest Backend (Spring Boot): Manages flow and logic.
- LLM Service (Ollama/OpenAI): Generates and evaluates questions.
- Interview DB (PostgreSQL): Stores all session data.
- Transcript Exporter Tool: Sends final transcript to other systems.

*Relationships*:
- Candidate → UI → Backend → DB/LLM/Tool.

### MatchMaker (Agent 3) - Evaluation Agent

**Actor**: User
- Inputs the interview ID.

**Containers**:
- **MatchMaker Service**: Coordinates the fetching of transcripts and scoring logic.
- **Scoring Engine**: Applies rule-based or ML models to evaluate interview performance.
- **Interview Transcript DB**: Stores interview transcripts from IntelliQuest.
- **Report Generator**: Prepares the final report with scoring and insights.
- **Transcript Fetcher Tool**: Fetches the interview transcript based on the provided interview ID.

**Relationships**:
- UI → Service → Transcript Fetcher → DB → Scoring Engine → Report Generator
